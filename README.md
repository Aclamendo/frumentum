The vast majority of personal data storage has been added to .gitignore. However there may still be some present. By joining the server you give us full access to data provided by your minecraft client. At request we can backup, delete, and provide to you MOST of your data. However, server logs, as well as chat messages will not be removed, and areas of the game world you have interacted with will not be reverted. Server logs are strictly confidential, only available to the server admin, as such all personal data within is kept private. Chat logs cannot be cleared and are publicly available.
